## Internship Applications
I did my internship at Kadaster. A lot of data sets of Kadaster datasets are available as Linked data. I made two applications
that work with two different datasets.

### BRT namen zoeker
The brt is the Basis registration topography. In this datasets you will find dutch topographical object like cities, buildings, provinces.
This application will search for these object based on name.

### Verkaufsbücher
During the second world war germans there were properties sold by Germans whose owners were mostly Jewish. This application alows you to
search the dataset based on last, street or place name.

## Solid (Linked data)
Stands for Social linked data. An application can use a Solid pod to save app data. Uses linked data to save the application data.    
  
### Proof of concept for a solid application

### Beer application
This application is a untappd like app. In this app you can check in beers and share them with your friends. This application allows you to log in with you Solid pod. The data will be saved in there.
Tools: React.
